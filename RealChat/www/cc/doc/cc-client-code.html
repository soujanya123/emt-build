<h1>Code Generator</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>
    The Code Generator allows you to create URLs which allow your clients to access the chat rooms. The chat URLs
    specify which room the user will be directed to by default as well as the Theme, Language, and Profile used to
    display the client window. The chat URL can then be used within your website to allow your users to access the chat.
</p>

<br/>

<ul>
    <li><b>Default Room</b> - specifies the room which the user is taken to by default.</li>
    <li><b>Theme</b> - specifies the color scheme which should be used when displaying the client window.</li>
    <li><b>Profile</b> - specifies the functionality which will be available within the client interface.</li>
    <li><b>Language</b> - RealChat provides several languages which can be used to display the client window.</li>
</ul>

<br/>

<p>
    The Chat URL will update automatically as each parameter is changed. You can then copy and paste this url to your
    website. Depending on your website, you may want to have the RealChat client display in a popup window or display
    within an iframe.
