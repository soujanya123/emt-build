<h1>Control Center</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>
    The RealChat Control Center is a web-based application which provides complete control over your RealChat
    server and makes administration easy. To use the Control Center, simply point your browser to the address shown when
    RealChat starts (or use the Start menu link on Windows).<br/><br/>
    The Control Center has the following sections:
</p>

<h2>General</h2>

<p>
    Provides help links, a means for changing passwords, bind settings, system information, and advanced settings to set
    connection limits, set allowances for incoming messages, and define the server mode. For more information on each
    page within the General section, please see the <a href="cc-general.html">General Section documentation</a>.
</p>

<h2>Server</h2>

<p>
    The Server section lets you configure the server, set up chat room options, set user permissions, control user
    behavior and define what logging should be performed. For more information on each page within the Server section,
    please see the <a href="cc-server.html">Server Section documentation</a>.
</p>

<h2>Client</h2>

<p>
    The Client section provides a visual theme editor, interface settings editor, and a
    HTML code generator for creating chat URLs. For more information on each page within the Client section,
    please see the <a href="cc-client.html">Client Section documentation</a>.
</p>

<h2>Usage Monitor</h2>

<p>
    The Usage Monitor section gives you a quick visual aide for monitoring the traffic on your chat site. You can also
    browse rooms to monitor activity and manage the ban list. For more information on each page within the Usage Monitor
    section, please see the <a href="cc-monitor.html">Usage Monitor Section documentation</a>.
