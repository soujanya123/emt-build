<h1>User Permissions</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>
    The user permissions page allows you to determine how users can gain operator or administrator permissions. These
    enhanced permissions give users the ability to warn other users, kick them from a chat room, and even ban them from
    chatting. The administration commands and permissions are further described in the <a
        href="chatroom-administration.html">Chat Room Administration</a> topic.
    <br/><br/>
    There are two methods of giving user's enhanced privileges. The first method is creating a list of passwords which
    are used with the <code>/pass</code> command. The second method is creating a list of user names which should be
    automatically promoted to administrators or operators.
</p>

<h2>Shared Passwords</h2>

<p>
    If you enable the Shared Passwords option, RealChat will display two lists. The first list is a list of
    Administrator passwords and the second is a list of operator passwords. In both lists, each password should be
    separated with commas.
    <br/><br/>
    To use a password, the user will enter the <code>/pass</code> command in the chat window and then the password. For
    example if
    the password is <i>admin</i>, the user would enter <code>/pass admin</code> in the chat window.
    <br/><br/>
    When using shared passwords, make sure that the passwords are not easy to guess and that only administrators and
    operators know the appropriate commands. You should also change passwords on a regular basis.
</p>

<h2>Predefined User Lists</h2>

<p>
    When the <b>Use predefined user lists</b> option is turned on, RealChat will display two lists. Each list will
    contain a list of the user names that should be given administrator rights and operator rights respectively.
    <br/><br/>
    The predefined user lists should be used when RealChat is <a href="database-integration.html">integrated with an existing website</a> and
    all users have login links automatically generated for them. HMAC authentication should also be used so that a
    normal user cannot forge a login to gain administrator rights.
