<h1>Room Browser</h1>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>
    The room browser shows you a list of all rooms that are available on the chat server.
    <br/><br/>
    The name of the room is shown with the number of users within the room. The room topic is then listed. A list of the
    current users in the room is then shown.
    <br/><br/>
    If the room has a password or is hidden, that information will be displayed on the right side of the list.

    two users in the room are admin and mark.
