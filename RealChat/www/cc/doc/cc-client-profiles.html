<h1>Client Profiles</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>

    The Client Profiles page allows you to define what functionality is available within the client. Using profiles
    allows you to ensure that your users do not have access to functionality which you do not want them to have. You can
    also reduce the functionality of the client to avoid confusing your users with advanced functionality.
    <br/><br/>
    All changes will take effect when a user logs in. Users who are already logged in will retain their current
    settings.
</p>

<h3>Profile List</h3>

<p>
    The profile list at the top of the Control Center allows you to choose which profile is active for editing. There
    are a total of 5 profiles that can be modified according to your needs. Each of the 5 profiles is pre-configured for
    common chat capabilities.
    <br/><br/>

    <b>Profile Name</b> - allows you to define the name of the profile which will be displayed in the Code Generator.
    Please
    select a name which is memorable and descriptive.
</p>


<h3>User Permissions</h3>

<p>
    The User Permissions section allows you to control what advanced functionality is available to your users in the
    Chat Window. You can modify the following settings:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Set avatar/profile URLs</b> - when this is disabled, the Advanced options link on the Welcome page is
        disabled so
        the users cannot enter avatars and profiles.
    </li>
    <li><b>Create rooms</b> - when this is disabled, users cannot create rooms from the Room List.</li>
    <li><b>Switch rooms</b> - when this is disabled, users cannot change to other rooms and they must stay in the
        default room
        that was specified when they login. You can generate different chat urls using the code generator to direct
        users to a specific chat room upon login.
    </li>
    <li><b>Send private messages</b> - when this is disabled, users cannot send private messages to other users.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Settings Dialog</h3>

<p>
    The settings dialog can be accessed within the client and it allows users to customize the appearance of their chat
    room. This section of the client profiles page allows you to determine what controls are available to your users.
    <br/><br/>
    Each setting corresponds to a checkbox within the settings dialog. If the setting is enabled in the Client Profile,
    it will also be enabled by default in the users client settings dialog. The user can still override each setting,
    unless the Settings button is disabled in UI Elements section below.
</p>


<h3>UI Elements</h3>

<p>
    The UI Elements section is used to customize what functionality is available to your users within the chat window.
    If an element is disabled, it will not be available for usage within the chat client.
    <br/><br/>
    After you make changes, you can use the <b>Apply &amp; Preview</b> button to see the effects of your changes.
    <br/><br/>
    The client interface is composed of three panels. These panels can be enabled and disabled independently. Within
    each panel there may be additional areas which can be enabled or disabled.

    <b>Chat panel options bar</b> - The chat panel options bar is shaded with blue in the image above. It contains the
    name of the current room as well as controls for changing rooms, changing settings, showing the client help, and
    closing the chat client. Each of these controls can be hidden individually.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Input panel</b> - The Input Panel is highlighted in red. The Input Panel allows users to type and submit messages

    panel.

    the users who are currently taking part in the chat. You may want to disable this panel if you do not want users to

    attendees talk to each other.
