<h1>Access Control Page</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>
    The access control page allows you to change the password needed to access the Control Center and it also allows you
    limit the IP addresses which can be used to access the Control Center.
</p>

<h2>Changing the administrator password</h2>

<p>
    After you install RealChat, the first thing you should do is change the administrator password. If you do not change
    the administrator password, then anyone who knows the default password can enter the control panel and make changes.
    When you select a password, make sure that it cannot be easily guessed. We recommend that your password be at least
    8 characters in length and that you use a mixture of upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and symbols.
</p>


<h2>Restricting Administrator access</h2>

<p>
    Specifying Trusted IP addresses is a powerful way to ensure that unauthorized users cannot enter the control panel
    even if they know the Administrator password. To use Trusted IP addresses, simply enter the IP addresses which
    should be allowed to access the control panel. For example, if you are using a remote server, you should enter the
    IP addresses which you use to access the control panel from work and/or from home. IP addresses should be entered
    one per line.
    <br/><br/>
    If your IP address is not static, you may need to use masks to specify a range of IP addresses. For example,
    192.168.0.* will allow all IP addresses from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255 to access the control panel. When using
    masks, make sure that they are as restrictive as possible. The mask *.*.*.* will allow access from anywhere and it's
    use is not recommended.
    <br/><br/>
    In case your ISP suddenly changes your static IP address which you have set as Trusted IP, you will be unable to access
    RealChat Control Center. To fix that, SSH to the server and edit the <code>/conf/ControlCenter.conf</code> file to update
    the Trusted IP line. Then restart the RealChat service (<code>./realchat stop</code> followed by <code>./realchat start</code>).
