<h1>Welcome</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>
    The Welcome page displays general information about RealChat and includes information about how to display this help
    manual and how to receive help if you have any questions about using RealChat.
    <br/><br/>
    If RealChat has just been installed, the bottom of the welcome page will also include information about the
    remaining steps that should be completed to setup and secure your chat server. Clicking on a step will take you the
    correct panel to complete that step. After you complete each step, the step will be crossed out. For more
    information on setting up your website, see the <a href="howto-setup.html">Basic Server
    Configuration</a> topic.
    <br/><br/>
    After you have successfully configured the server, you may want to select the <b>When starting, go directly to the
    Room Browser</b> checkbox. This will cause RealChat to bypass the Welcome page when you open the Control Center.
    Instead, you will be taken directly to the Room Browser.
