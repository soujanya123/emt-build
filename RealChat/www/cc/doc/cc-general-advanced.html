<h1>Advanced</h1>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>
    The Advanced Page allows you to modify settings which can improve the performance of your RealChat server. The
    following settings can be modified.
</p>

<h2>Connection limit</h2>

<p>
    This setting controls the total number of simultaneous connections that can be made to the chat server. The server
    will stop accepting connections when this limit is reached. When one or more connections are closed, the server will
    begin accepting connections again. The default value for this server is 3000 users. If you do not want to have a
    fixed limit, you can change this value to -1.
</p>


<h2>IP limit</h2>

<p>
    This setting controls the total number of simultaneous connections from a single IP address. The default value for
    this setting is 10. If you do not want to have a fixed limit, you can change this value to -1.
</p>

<h2>Subnet limit</h2>

<p>
    Limits the total number of simultaneous connections from the same subnet (the first three components of the ip
    address); for example, 192.168.0.* The default value for this setting is 100. If you do not want to have a fixed
    limit, you can change this value to -1.
</p>

<h2>Server mode</h2>

<p>
    The Test Mode allows you to run benchmark scripts against the server. Test Mode ignores the limits which you have
    placed on numbers of Connections for IP/Subnet, and also ignores FloodChecks and HMAC authentication. However, in
    Test Mode, the number of users per room remains valid, so that you can make measurements based on this setting.
    <br/><br/>
    Because the Test Mode is less secure and may have performance issues, please make sure to return the Server Mode to
    Protected after your testing is finished.
