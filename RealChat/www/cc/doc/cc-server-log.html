<h1>Log Settings</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>
    The log settings define what types of information is logged. The log files are all stored within the logs
    sub-directory where RealChat was installed.
</p>

<h2>Logging options</h2>

<p>
    The logging options are all self-explanatory. You can optionally log when users enter and exit the chat server, log
    public messages, log private messages, and log messages in user created rooms.
    <br/><br/>
    When logging messages, please make sure to respect your user's privacy. If you are logging private messages, you
    should make your users aware that the chat may be monitored and recorded.
</p>

<h2>Log file rotation</h2>

<p>
    This setting determines how often new log files will be created. The available options are Daily, Monthly, and when
    specific size limits are reached of either 10MB or 50MB.
    <br/><br/>
    Your choice of log rotation frequency will be based largely on the amount of traffic your website receives as well
    as the amount of logging you do.
