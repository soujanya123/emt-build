<h1>Room Settings</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>
    The Room settings page allows you to define which rooms are available within the chat server and allows you to
    define a variety of settings for each room.
</p>

<h2>Room List</h2>

<p>
    The room list is available at the top of the screen. You can change which room is currently selected for editing
    using the drop down list. The room settings apply to the currently selected room.

</p>

<h2>Adding a Room</h2>

<p>
    To add a room, select the Add link. RealChat will create a new room named untitled and it will make the new room
    active. Before selecting the add link, make sure to apply any changes you have made to the current room.
</p>

<h2>Removing a Room</h2>

<p>
    To remove a room, select the Remove link. RealChat will ask you to confirm that you do want to remove the room. If
    you agree, the room will be removed and the first room in the list will become active.
</p>

<h2>Room Name</h2>

<p>
    The room name is shown in the chat client so that users know what room they are in. It is also displayed in a list
    when the user changes rooms. You should have each room be unique so that users can easily determine what room they
    should enter.
</p>

<h2>Room Topic</h2>

<p>
    The room topic is used to help a user to know which room will best suit their needs. The topic is displayed in the
    list of rooms when the user selects the Change room button within the Chat Client. If you leave this blank, the list
    of rooms will show no topic.
</p>

<h2>Room Password</h2>

<p>
    The optional room password allows you to force a user to enter a password before they can enter a room. Room
    passwords are typically used for private rooms that you do not want the general public to use.
</p>

<h2>Visibility</h2>

<p>
    The visibility setting determines whether or not the room is visible in the room list when changing rooms. If you
    set the visibility to hidden, the only method of accessing that room is via a direct chat url.
