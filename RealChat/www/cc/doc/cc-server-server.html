<h1>Server Settings</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>
    The Server Settings page allows you to configure login requirements as well as room settings which are shared for
    all rooms.
</p>

<h2>Server Status</h2>

<p>
    The server status drop down list allows you to temporarily close the chat server so that the chat rooms are not
    open.
    When the chat server is closed, no users can chat. This is useful if you only want to allow chats at specific times
    of the day.
</p>

<h2>HMAC authentication</h2>

<p>
    This setting allows you to determine if HMAC-based client-server authentication must be used during the login
    process. When integrating RealChat with a membership database, you should
    enable this option to prevent people from logging into the chat rooms with faked user data.
</p>

<h2>Double login policy</h2>

<p>
    This setting allows you to determine how to handle situations where two users attempt to login using the same
    nickname. The available actions are:
    <br/><br/>
    <code>Deny</code> - Causes RealChat to reject the second connection.<br/>
    <code>Allow</code> - Allow the second connection, but RealChat appends a random number to the nickname so the users can be
    identified.<br/>
    <code>Boot Other</code> - Allows the second connection and boots the original connection which used the duplicate nickname. 
</p>

<h2>Users per room</h2>

<p>
    This setting is used to limit the total number of users in a room. When this limit is reached, a new 'spare' room is
    automatically created and all new users are automatically sent to this room. If this value is set above 50, the
    performance of the chat may be degraded. You may set this value to blank to remove all limits, but that is not
    recommended. The default value for this setting is 50.
</p>

<h2>Welcome message</h2>

<p>
    The welcome message is the first message sent to users when they enter the chat server. You should change this
    message to include your website name and describe any rules that you have for your users.
