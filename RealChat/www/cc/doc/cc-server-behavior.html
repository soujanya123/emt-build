<h1>Behavior Control</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>
    The behavior control page gives you control over several automatic features which help you to control problem users.
    Each feature is described below.
</p>

<h2>Max Message Length</h2>

<p>
    The maximum message length control allows you to control how many characters can be typed and then sent to the chat
    server at one time.
</p>

<h2>Default Ban Timeout</h2>

<p>
    This setting defines the default ban timeout in minutes. When a user has been kicked out of a chat room, they cannot
    rejoin the conversation until the ban times out. The ban timeout value applies to the following
    situations:<br/><br/>
    Users automatically kicked for flooding.<br/>
    Users automatically kicked for profanity.<br/>
    Users kicked by operator/administrator.<br/>
</p>

<h2>Kick URL</h2>

<p>
    This setting is an optional URL which users are redirected to after they have been kicked out of a chat sever either
    by the automatic functionality or manually by an operator or administrator. The full url should be provided. I.e.
    <code>http://www.yourdomain.com/sitepolicies.htm</code>
    <br/><br/>
    We suggest that this page that explains your chat community policies as well as why users may be kicked or banned.
</p>

<h2>Warn and Kick Users who are flooding</h2>

<p>
    When enabled, this setting will cause the chat server to automatically warn and then kick any user that rapidly
    enters chat messages without pause.
</p>

<h2>Warn and Kick Inactive Users</h2>

<p>
    When enabled, this setting will cause the chat server to automatically warn and then kick any user that has not
    typed a message for the specified time period.
</p>

<h2>Profane Word Filter</h2>

<p>
    When you enable the profane word filter, the Control Center will display two additional controls which allow you to
    control which words are filtered and what consequences are applied to users who are repeat offenders.
</p>

<h2>Warn then Kick Users who use profane words</h2>

<p>
    When this setting is enabled, the chat server will automatically warn and then kick any user that uses profanity
    more than the specified number of times. If this setting is not used, the profanity will simply be replaced with
    dashes, but users will not be kicked off.
</p>

<h2>Profane words list</h2>

<p>
    The profane words list is a comma-separated list of prohibited words. The filter replaces
    each word from the list with a mask like this: <code>---</code>.
    <br/><br/>
    Filtering is processed on the client side, so the original content is still logged on the server side. You may also
    use regular expressions to define several related words at one time.
