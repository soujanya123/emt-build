<h1>Setting Up Your RealChat Server</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>
    This guide will take you through the introductory steps that must be performed to setup a RealChat server.
</p>


<h2>Step 1) Install RealChat</h2>

<p>
    The first step in setting up a RealChat is installing it on your server. To run RealChat, your server must
    meet the following minimum requirements:
</p>

<ul class="dsc">
    <li>A dedicated server or unrestricted shell account on a shared server.</li>
    <li><a href="http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">Java Runtime Environment</a> installed on the server (can be
        installed with RealChat).
    </li>
    <li>UNIX, Linux or Windows operating system.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    After you have ensured that your server can be used with RealChat, you can install the server. If you are installing
    on UNIX or Linux, the installation instructions are located <a href="install-unix.html">here</a>. If you are
    installing on a Windows Server, the installation instructions are located <a href="install-windows.html">here</a>.
    <br/><br/>
    After the installation finishes, you should be able to access the <a href="control-center.html">control center</a>.
    If you are unable to access the control center, please verify that the firewall on the server has been configured to
    allow requests on the control center port. If you need assistance configuring the Windows Firewall, please see the
    <a href="howto-firewall.html">How to Configure the Windows Firewall</a> topic.
</p>

<h2>Step 2) Restrict Access to the Control Center</h2>

<p>
    After you login to the control center the first thing you should do is change the administrator password so that
    unauthorized users cannot login. This is done on the <a href="cc-general-access.html">Access Control</a> page. At
    the same time, you can restrict access to only allow specific IP addresses to access the control center.
</p>


<h2>Step 3) Adjust Bind Settings</h2>

<p>
    After you have properly restricted access so that unauthorized users cannot access the control center, you should
    verify that the Bind Settings are correct. The bind settings can be modified on the <a href="cc-general-bind.html">Bind
    Settings</a> page. The bind settings control what IP address and ports are used to access the control center as well
    as the chat client. When you adjust the bind settings, make sure to adjust your firewall to allow the appropriate
    connections.
</p>

<h2>Step 4) Configure the Chat Rooms</h2>

<p>
    Now that your server is installed, you should decide what rooms you want your chat server to have and what
    permissions you want your users to have. For more information on this step, please see the <a
        href="howto-rooms.html">How to Manage your Chat Rooms</a> topic.
</p>

<h2>Step 5) Personalize RealChat for Your Site</h2>

<p>
    You can change the RealChat server Welcome message on the <a href="cc-server-server.html">Server Settings</a> page.
    With the Enterprise Edition you may also change the Private Brand which is also on the Server Settings page to
    contain the name of your website or company.
    <br/><br/>
    The chat client window can be customized to match the appearance of your website so that your users look at the chat
    functionality as an extension of your own website. The colors are customized on the <a href="cc-client-themes.html">Color
    Themes</a> page. Color themes allow you to define the specific colors used to display each element within the
    client window.
    <br/><br/>
    The <a href="cc-client-profiles.html">Client Profiles</a> page allows you to define what functionality is available
    within the client. Using profiles allows you to ensure that your users do not have access to functionality which
    you do not want them to have. You can also reduce the functionality of the client to avoid confusing your users with
    advanced functionality.
</p>

<h2>Step 6) Provide Links to Your Chat Rooms</h2>

<p>
    If you have an existing website which already has a user management component, you can <a
        href="database-integration.html">integrate RealChat</a> with your existing system so that your users do not need
    to log-in to RealChat as a separate step and to ensure that only users who are already registered with your website
    can access the chat.
    <br/><br/>
    If you do not have an existing membership database, you can simply use the <a href="cc-client-code.html">Code
    Generator</a> to create links to your chat system.
