<h1>Client Themes</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>
    The color themes page allows you to customize the look and feel of the RealChat client window so that it matches
    your existing website.
</p>

<h3>Theme List</h3>

<p>
    The theme list at the top of the Control Center allows you to choose which theme is active for editing. There are a
    total of 10 themes that can be modified according to your needs. Five of the them are pre-configured, and the
    remaining five are blank. You may modify any of the themes.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Theme Name</b> - allows you to define the name of the theme which will be displayed in the Code Generator.
    </li>
    <li><b>Save</b> - The Save button will save any changes that have been made to the profile.</li>
    <li><b>Reset</b> - The Reset button will reset the theme to the colors that were selected when the theme was last
        saved.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Color Controls</h3>

<p>
    The color controls are used to set the color of various user interface elements. When you change a color, the live
    preview will be automatically updated. If you change your mind about the color settings, you can select the Reset
    button to revert to the previous colors.
    <br/><br/>
    To modify a color, first select the user element you want to modify. The name of each element is displayed in a tool
    tip when you move the cursor over the element. When you select an element, the name of the element is displayed in
    bold face next to the Selected label i.e:
    <br/><br/>
    Selected: <b>Desktop background</b>
    <br/><br/>
    After you select an element, you can modify the color by selecting a color in the color picker or by typing a color
    and pressing the Tab key.
    All colors are hexadecimal RGB colors.
