<h1>Bind Settings</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>
    The bind settings page controls what ports are used by RealChat to serve the public
    chat service and to handle the control center. After installing RealChat, you should verify that these ports are not
    being blocked by a firewall and that they do not conflict with other applications running on the sever. If you
    determine that there is a conflict, press the <b>Probe Options</b> button to have RealChat search for alternative
    ports.
    RealChat will display a list of alternatives for the Chat Service as well as the Control Center. You can either
    leave the settings at no change, or you can select another IP address and port to use.
    <br/><br/>
    If your chat users will be located behind firewalls, we recommend that port <b>443</b> or <b>80</b> is used for the
    chat service. On Unix and Linux systems, ports lower than 1024 can only be used by the system administrator (root
    user), so you must run RealChat as root to achieve that.
    <br/><br/>
    If you are also running a web server on the same host, you will need at least two IP
    addresses (one for the web server and one for RealChat server). The web server
    must be configured so it does not bind to all interfaces. For Apache servers, this is done
    using the <a target="_blank" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mpm_common.html#listen">Listen</a>
    configuration directive. For Microsoft IIS, you must configure
    each host for a specific address and disable Socket Pooling. See the Microsoft Knowledge Base article <a
        target="_blank" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q238131/">Q238131</a> for
    more information.
    <br/><br/>
    If you host RealChat on a Windows server or home computer, to allow users to access the chat server, you must
    correctly <a href="howto-firewall.html">configure the Windows Firewall</a>.
