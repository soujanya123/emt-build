<h1>Manage Your Chat Rooms</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>
    RealChat installs two sample rooms by default. These rooms are called Lobby and Staff Only. In most cases, you will
    want to either modify these rooms, or add additional rooms.
</p>

<h2>Adding a New Room</h2>

<p>
    To add a room, use the <a href="cc-server-room.html">Room Settings</a> page and select the Add link.
</p>


<h2>Editing Room Properties</h2>

<p>
    To edit a room, you use the <a href="cc-server-room.html">Room Settings</a> page. First select the room which you
    want to edit in the Room List.
    <br/><br/>
    After you have selected the room you wish to edit, set a room name which describes the room. You should also define
    a topic which is meaningful to your users. For example, if you want to create a room where your users can discuss
    poker strategy, you could call the room "Poker Strategy" and the topic to: "Discuss how to bluff other players and
    win at poker".
    <br/><br/>
    After you define the room name and topic, you need to determine who should be able to access the room. For
    example, if you have a chat room dedicated to internal projects for your company, you would not want the chat room
    to be exposed to the general public. There are two methods protecting the chat room. The first is defining a
    password for the room. This password should only be made available to users you trust. The second method of
    protection is making the chat room invisible. If the room is invisible, it must be accessed by a direct url. You can
    create the url using the <a href="cc-client-code.html">Code Generator</a>. You can also use direct integration to
    allow your users to access the hidden rooms.
</p>

<h2>Deleting a Room</h2>

<p>
    Deleting a room is also done on the <a href="cc-server-room.html">Room Settings</a> page. First select the room
    which you want to delete in the Room List and then click on the Remove Link.

</p>

<h2>Controlling the Maximum Number of Users in a Room</h2>

<p>
    To control the maximum number of users that can be in a room at any time, use the <b>Users per room</b> setting on
    the <a href="cc-server-server.html">Server Settings</a> page. Please be aware that this is the maximum number of
    users that can be in any room at one time. If the maximum number of users is reached a 'spare' room is created
    automatically.
</p>

<h2>Letting Users Change Rooms and Create Rooms</h2>

<p>
    You can determine whether or not users can change rooms using profiles. You configure profiles on the <a
        href="cc-client-profiles.html">Client Profiles</a> page. You disable the ability to switch rooms using the
    <b>Switch Rooms</b> setting. If you want your users to be able to change between rooms, but you do not want them to
    be able
    to create private rooms, you can disable the <b>Create Rooms</b> setting.
