<h1>Configure the Windows Firewall</h1>

    This topic applies to users hosting RealChat on a Windows server or home computer.

<h2>Configure the Windows Firewall</h2>

<p>
    In order to allow users to access the chat server, you must correctly configure the Windows Firewall. The Windows
    Firewall is accessed from the Control Panel. After you open the firewall settings, you need to manage the exceptions
    list. The exceptions list is managed on the Exceptions tab:

    To allow access to the Control Center, first select the <b>Add Port</b> button.

    <br/><br/>

    In the Add a Port dialog enter a memorable name and enter the Port number that you have configured in the <a
        href="cc-general-bind.html">Bind Settings</a>, and select the OK button. Repeat these steps for the chat server
    as well as the control center.
    <br/><br/>
    If you are using a different firewall, the steps will be similar to the above.
    <br/><br/>
    If you are running RealChat on a home computer, you need to ensure that your ISP will allow connections to your
    computer. If you have problems with users connecting to your chat server, check with your ISP to ensure that the
    ports that are specified in the bind settings are enabled and ask them to enable them if they are not.
