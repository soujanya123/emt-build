<h1>Deal With Problem Users</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>
    Unfortunately, a chat system may have users that do not play nicely with others. RealChat provides several options
    for dealing with users that simply cannot get along with other people and either harass other users, use profanity,
    or simply refuse to follow the rules you outline.
</p>

<h2>Becoming an Administrator/Operator</h2>

<p>
    In order to access the controls for managing problem users, you will first need to become an operator or an
    administrator. An operator can warn users, freeze them, and kick them off the server. Administrators can also ban
    users and moderate conversations. For more information on each type of user's permissions, see the <a
        href="chatroom-administration.html">Chat Room Administration</a> page.
</p>


<h2>Warning Users</h2>

<p>
    If a user is not behaving appropriately, the first step is to warn them that their behavior is not appropriate. To
    warn a user, simply click on their name in the participants list and then select <b>Warn</b> from the context menu.

</p>

<h2>Freezing Users</h2>

<p>
    If a user continues to misbehave, you can Freeze them. Freezing causes any messages which a user types to not be
    displayed by the chat server. The server will also also tell them that they have been frozen and how much longer the
    freeze will last. This is a great option if the discussion gets heated and the participants need a chance to settle
    down. To freeze a user, simply click on their name in the participants list and then select <b>Freeze</b> from the
    context menu.
</p>

<h2>Kicking and Banning Users</h2>

<p>
    If a user does not respond to a warning or a freeze, the next step is to kick them from from the server.
    When a user is kicked, they will be automatically logged out of the chat server and a short ban will be placed on
    the user. After the ban expires, the user will be able to log in again. To kick a user, simply click on their name
    in the participants list and then select <b>Kick</b> from the context menu. The length of time the user is banned is
    determined by the <i>Default Ban Timeout</i> setting on the <a href="cc-server-behavior.html">Behavior Control</a>
    page.
    <br/><br/>
    If the user is a repeat offender or if you would like to ban the user for a longer period than the default, you can
    Ban the user instead of kicking them. To ban a user, simply click on their name in the participants list and then
    select <b>Ban</b> from the context menu. RealChat will display the dialog below:
    <br/><br/>
    <img src="images/ban_dialog.png" alt="RealChat ban dialog"/>
    <br/><br/>
    The ban dialog lets you enter the reason for why the user is being banned with a length of time for the ban. You can
    also control whether the individual IP address is banned or if the entire subnet should be banned.
</p>

<h2>Using Profane Word Filtering</h2>

<p>
    If you want to avoid profanity within your chat rooms, you can use the profane word filter which is setup on the
    <a href="cc-server-behavior.html">Behavior Control</a> page. After the profane word filter is setup, any profanity
    will be replaced with <code>---</code>. You can optionally have the server kick any users that are using excessive
    profanity.
</p>


<h2>Moderating Chats</h2>

<p>
    If you would like complete control over a chat, you can use the <a href="moderated-chat.html">moderation
    functionality</a>. When you moderate a chat, all messages must be approved by an administrator before the chat
    server will display them.
