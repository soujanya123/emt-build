<h1>Usage Monitor</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>
    The usage monitor section allows you to monitor the chat server and gives you information about the number of
    users that are currently using the chat server, how many messages are being sent, where users are located, and any
    bans that are in effect. The Usage Monitor Section is divided into the following pages:
</p>

<br/>

<ul>
    <li><a href="cc-monitor-dashboard.html">Dashboard</a> - allows you to monitor the number of users on your chat
        server as well as the number of messages being handled by the chat server.
    </li>
    <li><a href="cc-monitor-browser.html">Room Browser</a> - allows you to view the available rooms as well as what
        users are in each room.
    </li>
    <li><a href="cc-monitor-banlist.html">Ban List</a> - The ban list shows you a list of what bans are currently
        active with information about when the ban is lifted and why the ban was placed. You can also lift individual
        bans or all bans.
    </li>
</ul>
