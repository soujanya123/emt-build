<h1>Installing on UNIX/Linux Platforms</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>Java Runtime Environment</h2>

<p>
    RealChat Server requires the Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in order to run. You can either choose to <a
        href="http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">download and install</a> the JRE
    prior to installing RealChat, or have the RealChat installer download a private JRE on demand. If you
    choose the latter, the JRE downloaded will be only available to RealChat, and not to other applications.
    <br/><br/>
    The on-demand JRE download works for Linux only; for other systems please install the JRE manually.
    <br/><br/>  
    The JRE should be installed to a common location such as <code>/usr/local/java/</code>,
    <code>/home/username/java/</code> or in the same location as RealChat itself so it can be found by the launcher
    script.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
    RealChat Server for UNIX/Linux platforms comes packaged as a single archive named <code>realchat-unix.tar.gz</code>.
    Extract the archive to a directory of your choice:<br/><br/>
    <code>tar -xzvf realchat-unix.tar.gz</code><br/><br/>
    A directory called RealChat is then created, which contains all of the program files. Navigate to that directory and
    execute
    the launcher script:<br/><br/>
    <code>cd RealChat<br/>
        ./realchat start</code>
    <br/><br/>
    The launcher script will try to locate your Java Interpreter, select suitable chat server ports, and start
    RealChat Server. After the script completes, a message similar to the following will be displayed:<br/><br/>
    <code>
        RealChat 5.0, Build: 582 (20070122)<br/>
        Free Trial, 5 users license, ID: n/a<br/>
        <br/>
        Point your browser to: http://192.168.0.10:10055/
    </code>
    <br/><br/>
    At this stage RealChat is installed and running on your server.
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>
    Further customization and administration of RealChat Server is done via the built-in web-based Control Center, which
    is accessible at the URL which is given in the final status message of the launcher script. The Control Center
    functionality is described in the <a href="control-center.html">next
    chapter</a>.<br/><br/>
</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>
    If the service fails to start please refer to the <code>out.log</code> file, located in the RealChat directory for
    diagnostic information.<br/><br/>
    To stop RealChat Server, use the command: <code>./realchat stop</code>
