<h1>Moderated Chat Events</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>Holding moderated or celebrity chats</h2>

<p>
    Chat room moderators have complete control over an ongoing chat session; they can approve or discard messages before
    they reach the audience, highlight a guest star user and more.
    <br/><br/>
    To become a moderator, once you are logged in as an administrator, use the <code>/moderate</code> command. The
    moderator window will appear, and all users in the room will see a message informing them that their messages
    are being forwarded to the moderator for approval.

</p>

<p>

    When you moderate a room, all user messages are sent to the moderator window message queue. Highlight a message and
    click the <b>Approve</b> button (green) to have this message posted to the audience. Click the <b>Discard</b> button
    (red) to remove the message from the queue, without posting it. The <b>Discard All</b> button will empty the message
    list.
    <br/><br/>
    If you invited guest-stars or speakers, you can enable all their messages by using the <code>/highlight
    {nickname}</code> command. The celebrity's nickname is then highlighted (just like as if they were an operator).
    <br/><br/>
    During a moderated chat, if you ignore someone (by clicking their name and selecting <b>Block</b>), no messages from
    that user will reach the moderator queue, effectively turning the blocked user into a spectator.
    <br/><br/>
    Use the <b>Stop Moderation</b> button to return the room back to normal chat mode.
