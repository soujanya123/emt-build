<h1>Installing on Windows Platforms</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>Java Runtime Environment</h2>

<p>
    RealChat Server requires the Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in order to run. You can either choose to <a
        href="http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">download and install</a> the JRE
    prior to installing RealChat, or have the RealChat installer download a private JRE on demand. If you
    choose the latter, the JRE downloaded will be only available to RealChat, and not to other applications.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
    RealChat Server for Windows platforms comes packaged as a single installation executable named <code>realchat-windows.exe</code>.
    The installer will try to locate your Java Interpreter, look for suitable chat server ports, install
    RealChat Server as Windows service, and start the server.
    <br/><br/>
    After the installation completes, RealChat will be installed and running on your server.
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>
    Further customization and administration of RealChat Server is done via the built-in web-based Control Center, which
    can be accessed from the Start Menu at:
    <br/><br/>
    <code>Start Menu/Programs/RealChat/Control Center</code><br/><br/>
    The Control Center functionality is described in the <a href="control-center.html">next chapter</a>.
</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>
    If the service fails to start please refer to the <code>out.log</code> file, located in the RealChat directory.<br/><br/>
    To start/stop RealChat Server, use the Windows services application.
